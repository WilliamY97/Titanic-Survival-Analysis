# Titanic Survival - Machine Learning Analysis

<b>This Project Has Been Confirmed As Successful By A Udacity Reviewer.</b>

Applied Machine Learning concepts and created decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features. The first project as a part of the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Program.

By analyzing the given data of the Titanic, I was able to create a decision tree to have an accuracy of 80.36% in predicting the survival of a passenger.
